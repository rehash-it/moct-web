                                                Ministry of Culture and Tourism- Historical Background
                                                Culture
                                                Beginning from the dawn of the 19th century, ‘modern European civilization gradually started taking momentum and grip in Ethiopia under the circumstances where power centralization of the central government was dominantly rampant in the country’, in which case modern management of culture has been addressed through the indirect management or administration of various Ministries and any other government agencies during the pre-and post-Fascist Italian Occupation, particularly in the post-independence/victory period.

                                                The disentanglement of multifaceted cultural activities from the existing traditional and customary cultural management patterns as well as the association of such cultural activities with the modern cultural management processes were unsystematic and disorganized until the end of the Hailesellasie/Imperial Regime. Accordingly, the current National Archives and Libraries Agency, which was established in 1943 under the official name of “Public Library-Wemzeker”, was proven to have been a pioneer in this respect; this Agency, which underlies the initiatives to undertake contemporary heritage research and preservation activities, includes the Ethiopian Ancient Heritages Administration. The relevant historical accounts reveal that the “Ministry of Education and Arts” was subsequently established to have comprised ‘Addis Ababa Art School’, ‘Etege Handcrafts School’, ‘Tegbared School’ and ‘Yared Musical School’ thereby establishing and managing Amharic Linguistics/ Yeamargna Merhalisan/ apart from carrying out its formal education programs.

                                                The Ministry of Information was established to, apart from conducting regular activities of information, set up and manage the Ethiopian Hager Fiker Theater, Haileselassie I Theater, National Theater of Ethiopia and various cinemas.

                                                In spite of the fact that the commencement and subsequent activities of modern cultural institutions and management patterns were initiated in disorganized manners, the required level of advancement regarding this sector has not been realized as symbiotic interactions among multi-dimensional were not provided with favorable conditions. As such, the pertinent historical accounts witness that different scholars, including local and African minds, who were interested in admiring and honoring the peoples and cultures of Ethiopia, have come up with various concepts concerning modern cultural management.
                                                The official letter written from the Ministry of Pen, the first Ministry regarding this sector, on 21/09/1974, stating “…following the establishment of the Ministry of Culture, it is hereby decided that all cultural offices or agencies shall be incorporated into this Ministry…”, has come up with the resolution on the incorporation of such agencies as Theaters and Cinemas of the Ministry of information, art department and Amharic linguistics of the Ministry of Education and Arts as well as national and historical archives of the Ministry of Pen, including the ancient heritages administration and national library-wemezeker, into such Ministry. Finally, the Proclamation No. 127/69 for Defining Mandates of Ministries, which was issued on 05/08/1977 after three years, has provided the Ministry of Culture and Sports with the relevant legal justification/Grounds further defining and strengthening the mandate of such Ministry, which was said to have officially kept functioning accordingly.

                                                This process was reported to have been positive development entailing substantial change in light of modern management of cultures, in which case, however, the establishment of such Ministry without conducting the corresponding studies and helping the Ministry meet the required ministerial organization and structural aspects was reported to have entailed limitations.

                                                Subsequently, as human and democratic rights of nations, nationalities and peoples are, as they have already been enshrined in the Charter of the transitional government, guaranteed and ratified in/by the FDRE Constitution, the dynamics of multifaceted spiritual and material cultures of peoples and the resultant modern management of cultures were reported to have markedly been active thereby regaining the momentum of modern organizational and management patterns. This was followed by the formulation of the Cultural Policy in 1997 in order to modernize and systematize the cultural management. The formulation and subsequent enactment of such cultural policy were/was proven to have been the second strongest achievement next to the establishment of the Ministry in the history of modern cultural management.

                                                However, the failure to, given the involvement in formulation and enactment of cultural policy for modern cultural management, develop specific implementation strategies for the policy and establish joint sector development program through the relevant terms of joint implementation has rendered the policy characterized by internal and external challenges.

                                                Furthermore, the review of internal and external dynamics surrounding the modern management of cultures indicates that, even if such management of disorganized and disarrayed nature has been centrally managed, such Ministry was characterized by occasional narrowing and broadening as well as annexation/merging and separation with/from other agencies throughout the period until the date of its reestablishment in 2005 as the Ministry of Cultures and Tourism as per the Proclamation No. 471/98. This trend has denied the Ministry of the opportunities for sustaining its stable organization.

                                                Finally, although the cultural management is known for its former centralized perspective and supervision system thereby providing wider opportunities and guarantees for making cultures within the bounds of the federal government and national regional states be honored among the peoples, the lack of homogenously structured institutional organization by which the Cultural bureaus of national regional states are linked to the Federal Ministry of Culture, in due course of centrally and regionally integrating/managing the modern cultural management, is still proven to have repelled the initiatives of mutual operational planning and integration as well as of joint decision-making.
                                                TOURISM
                                                Tourism gained a recognized organizational aspect as a separate sector in the 1957, during which tourism was provided with better orientations/perspectives and patterns of management. This period was characterized by peace and rehabilitation following the end of the World War II, in which case this initiative had been witnessing achievements across the European and Fareast countries. This period witnessed the rapid expansion of transport technologies, thereby resulting in cheap transportation costs/prices, especially airfares, as well as the dramatic advancement of global tourism activities due to a wide array of factors associated with the consideration of living standards of peoples in Europe and everywhere else.

                                                In due realization that tourism had been wining substantial benefits, direct and indirect ones, to such countries as Greece, Italy and Egypt as well as that the country, Ethiopia, is endowed with/renowned for its historical heritages and any other attractions required for/to be used for tourism development, the government caused the establishment of the first tourist bureau, which was then overseen/supervised by the office of the prime minister, in 1968 with an official mandate of reengineering, promoting and managing tourism activities in Ethiopia.

                                                The tourism sector, subjected to successive organizational changes, has been conducting/running tourism promotion and tour operations as well as the businesses of duty-free-shops, in which case a reasonable number of experts were trained establishing tourism and hotel/catering training institutes. With the view to address the problems associated with shortage of hotels, the government started encouraging interested parties/the private sector through the establishment of financial institutions and involvement in equity-investment based on loan-arrangements apart from its commitment to establishing/opening model-hotels. Such initiatives were further strengthened and refined throughout the period till the 1974 Revolution taking an integrated form.

                                                Nonetheless, the post-Revolution military government announced socialism in the country thereby nationalizing small and large scale business firms (both service providers and producers), in which case most of the hotels were nationalized under a central public corporation. Private tour operators/operations were procured and nationalized under “the National Tour Operations”, a public enterprise, where as the production and trading of cultural handicrafts/artifacts were, along with the duty-free-shops, were nationalized under another public agency/enterprise. The latter was provided with a supervising agency, namely the Ministry of National Resources Development, which was later succeeded by a separate/ an independent office i.e. “Ethiopian Tourism Commission”.
                                                Then after, even though the mixed-economic policy, which was, from its very inception during the Imperial Regime, enacted as of 1988 during the socialist system in the country, attracted investors, the hotel investment was relatively marked by the lowest level of advancement throughout the period till the change of regime in 1991. The post-Dergue – regime period witnessed the introduction of fundamental changes to the sector under consideration following the resort to taking promising/encouraging actions associated with the democratization, federal political ideology/perspective and free market economic system perused by the incoming regime.

                                                Consequently, the sector is currently entrusted with dual missions of creating favorable conditions helpful to ensure the country’s comparative advantages and accelerate sustainable development of the country based on poverty-alleviation by extending the contributions of its own to develop attractions of the country.  It is widely reported that the presence of a large number of international organizations in Ethiopia will draw benefits to the country, in due course of perusing its development initiatives, provided that the country gives due attention to its potentials for tourism. As such notion gained committed emphasis of the government, the ministry was reorganized as “the Ministry of Culture and Tourism” for the subsequent achievement of the implementation thereof in accordance with the Proclamation No. 471/1998 for Structure of Federal Government Implementing Organs.

                                                Currently, the newly introduced policy for such organizational and process/working change or transformation, which is reported to have been the first initiative in the history of the country’s tourism industry, has been ratified.  The incorporation of such sector into the previous Rapid and Sustainable Development Plan (PASDEP) pursued by the government for the past five years and into the upcoming five years Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) indicates the sensitive attention given to the sector.

                                                Even if there are no organizational and structural adjustments undertaken by the Office of the Prime Minister, the former management bodies have been replaced by the newly appointed youth top-level-management bodies, who are entrusted with pursuing the transformation/change one step forward. As such, we have come up with favorable conditions for matching the previous plans developed by the Ministry to the missions of the new management as well as for an insight assessment of the existing realities surrounding the sector to subsequently get geared into operations with the required human resources.
